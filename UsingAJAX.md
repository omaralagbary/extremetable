When creating a table with Java code using the eXtremeTable API it is now possible to combine AJAX technology to render the view. For those new to AJAX this means that the web page does not have to refresh to navigate the eXtremeTable! The only real hook to use this feature is to use the new Table onInvokeAction attribute to give the javascript method that should be invoked. One of the most powerful aspects of the AJAX integration is there is no integration. The eXtremeTable has a very clear and easy API to use and so this was the logical next step. This also means you can use your favorite AJAX technology as the eXtremeTable does not actually integrate with any specific one. See the [tutorial](AJAXEnabledTutorial.md) for more information.
